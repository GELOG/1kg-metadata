# 1000 Genome Project Metadata

## What is the 1000 Genome Project ?
Recent improvements in sequencing technology ("next-gen" sequencing platforms) have sharply reduced the cost of sequencing. The 1000 Genomes Project is the first project to sequence the genomes of a large number of people, to provide a comprehensive resource on human genetic variation.

## What is this GitHub project?
The freely available data of the 1000 Genome Project represents more than 600 TB spread over thousands of directories and files. Mirroring this data source is a challenge, and browsing it online is a bit slow. Even documenting this data in a spreadsheet is a challenge (over 2 millions cells).

The original goal of this project is create a database of the metadata of the 1000 Genome Project (filenames, file types, sequencing parameters, file size, nb of reads, etc.)
